Project name: Pilea

Authors: Sebastjan Mevlja and Beti Piščanec.

## Summary

We've decided to create Pilea, an android application that will help us care for our plants. Pilea lets you catalog your plants and their watering cycles, as well as their pictures, descriptions and notes. All in an effort to ease plant care. Users can access their profiles from different devices without having to worry about data loss since their profiles sync automatically with the database.
